//So we will probably have some Async issues we will have to work out together
/*
my idea is we have a pop up show up with nothing on it. at the same time my fucntion will get called. after
it has data it will call this function and pass it a link. from here just one link will be made and posted.
once its posted there the use can choose it, we can have a small loading sign to indicate that more could be coming.

After the link is chosen GetData(Array) will need to be called with the chosen Array passed into it
 */
// The format for displaying is [ChosenX, type, link, type, link.....link, type, ChosenY] of arbitrary length
//TODO: Modify GetData to accept the array and adjust the query. For Landon

function DisplayLink(Array){
    //TODO: Make some UI magic happen For UI person.
